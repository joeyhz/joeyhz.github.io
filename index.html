        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Joey Horwitz and I'm an Embedded Software Engineer at GDEB who recently graduated from Cornell 
            University with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I love working with embedded systems and am
            also self-taught in web development. Below is a selection of some of the projects
            I've completed for fun or for school. You can also view my LinkedIn for
            more information on my professional work. Hope you enjoy!</p>

                <h3>Smart Beehive</h3>
            </a>
            <p>An IoT-based beehive monitoring system that tracks temperature,
                humidity, and bee activity in real time. Assembles all diagnostics in web and mobile compatible
                platform, including comprehensive beehive health score. Also includes automated beehive entrance reducer
                and red/green indicator LED. Second place winner at Cornell Makeathon 2023.</p>

                <h3>Persistence of Vision Display</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Published in the November 2023 edition of Circuit Cellar Magazine, this project uses LEDs and a rotating arm
                to create a visual display that appears to be floating in the
                air. The outcome is a stable 28 inch RGB display running at 30 frames per second. It is
                capable of rendering images, GIFs and video selected
                from a live webpage.</p>
            <p>Check it out in publication! <a href="./images/circuit_cellar.pdf#page=6">Circuit Cellar</a>.</p>

            <p>A compass that points towards your destination. Uses an Android Kotlin app with 
                Google Places API for coordinate input and a stepper motor/IMU for output. A TCP socket 
            connection is used for communication.</p>

            <p>A client-side question and answer platform designed to assure the use of textual evidence in discussion
                of Jewish issues. Designed as a submission for the <i>Powered By Sefaria</i> coding competition. Built
                with JQuery and Firebase Realtime Database.</p>

                <h3>Autonomous Robot</h3>
            </a>
            <p>A custom autonomous robot that fuses inertial sensing and infrared time-of-flight sensor data to map and
                localize in a controlled environment. It also demonstrates motion control and state estimation using PID
                and Kalman filtering.</p>

                <h3>Social Media Chrome Extension</h3>
            </a>
            <p>A Chrome extension which allows people to make streaming a social experience. When someone is streaming
                similar content as a friend, they will be alerted to their friend's presence and given the opportunity
                to wave. This simulates bumping into a friend at a common space like a concert venue. Uses Firebase and
                Facebook APIs.</p>
